# Custermer statisfaction prediction

Using algrithms: Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Neural Networks (MLP), KMeans
Lanagauge: Python

## Objective
Using algorithm to make the prediction model.

## Results
Using the neural networks (MLP) with pca datasets work the best for this solution, the hyperparameters are used with (lr=0.01)the loss curve represents as below.

If we plot out the roc curve, we can clearly see the good performance of MLP.
